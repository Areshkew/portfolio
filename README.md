# Portfolio Repository

Welcome to my portfolio repository! This repository contains the source code and assets for my personal portfolio website. 
Here, you can explore my projects, learn about my skills and experience, and get in touch with me.

## Website Preview

Before you proceed, please note that the website is optimized for desktop and may not display properly on mobile devices. 
Responsive design has not been implemented yet, so I recommend viewing the site on a desktop or laptop for the best experience.

## Browser Compatibility

To ensure the best browsing experience, it is recommended to use the latest version of modern web browsers that support CSS nesting.
The website extensively uses CSS nesting features, and older browsers may not render the styles correctly or may fail to display the website at all.

Please make sure you have the latest versions of popular browsers such as:

- Google Chrome
- Mozilla Firefox
- Safari
- Microsoft Edge

If you encounter any issues or find that the website is not displaying as intended, please try accessing it with a compatible browser or updating your current browser to the latest version.
